# jalapeno
A package to help make figures and movies for journal articles and presentations with Matplotlib.

jalapeno does not add functionality to Matplotlib, it simply makes it easier to generate precisely sized figures with color schemes.
And movies for both data analysis (low quality) and presentations (high quality)!
It is meant for journal figures and figures/movies for presentations.

A simple example of jalapeno in action: suppose you make a bunch of figures on a white background for a journal, only to find out that your company does all presentations on black slides.
jalapeno is meant to make these switches in color scheme easier.
Additionally those journal figures are likely inappropriate for your slides - you need bolder lines and bigger text.
jalapeno is meant to facilitate these sudden changes too.
